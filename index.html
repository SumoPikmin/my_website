      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a second-year Master's student at the Technical University of Darmstadt specializing in Natural Language
        Processing and Machine Learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Darmstadt. As part of my
        studies, I completed two exchange semesters abroad — at Högskolan i Skövde, Sweden (January 2023 – June 2023)
        and National Taiwan University, Taiwan (February 2025 – June 2025) — gaining international academic and cultural
        experience.

      I am currently seeking a Master's thesis opportunity with a company located in the Munich area to gain valuable industry experience while completing my degree. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me.</p>

          <strong>Bachelor's Thesis: Evaluating Cultural Diversity in Text-to-Image Models </strong>
          <br><i>(June 2024 – December 2024)</i><br><br>
          During my Bachelor thesis, I developed a large-scale benchmark to evaluate cultural biases in cutting-edge Text-to-Image models such as Stable Diffusion XL and FLUX.1. 
          By leveraging a multilingual dataset spanning 2500 concepts in five languages and over 2.3 million compositional prompts, 
          I designed an innovative evaluation pipeline using advanced Visual Question Answering models like Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct to accurately measure text-image alignment. 
          This research revealed a significant performance gap of over 10% when generating content related to non-Western cultures, highlighting systemic cultural and multilingual biases in current generative AI systems. 
          The project was awarded an outstanding grade of 1.0 (A+).

          <strong>Traffic Management System: Incident Module</strong>
          <br><i>(Oct 2023 – March 2024)</i><br><br>
          As part of a university software project at the Institute for Railway Systems, TU Darmstadt, I created a simulation and GUI-based Incident Management Module for the Train Management System using Python and Tkinter.
          This tool allowed interactive configuration and management of over 25 railway incident scenarios, supporting training and operational planning. 
          I built a real-time simulation environment featuring incident visualization and implemented backend logic to execute scenarios and analyze system responses. 
          By applying agile methodologies including Scrum and conducting thorough usability testing, the module achieved a 30% improvement in task efficiency, demonstrating both technical and practical impact.

          <strong>Tutor, Department of Computer Science, Technical University Darmstadt</strong>
          <br><i>(Nov 2023 – Feb 2024, Nov 2022 – Feb 2023)</i><br><br>
          Subjects included Foundations of Language Technology, Introduction to Compiler Construction, and Visual
          Computing.
          <p>As a tutor in the Department of Computer Science, I helped clarify complex technical concepts to improve student understanding and engagement.
            I led interactive seminars designed to foster active participation, while working closely with teaching staff to enhance course delivery and organization for a smoother learning experience.</p>

          <strong>Mentor, IMS System, Department of Computer Science, Technical University Darmstadt</strong>
          <br><i>(Oct 2021 – Mar 2022)</i><br><br>
          <p>I served as a mentor for first-year students in the IMS System program, providing dedicated support through active listening and guided dialogue. 
            I conducted weekly coaching sessions aimed at encouraging self-reflection, goal-setting, and cultivating a growth mindset. 
            By closely monitoring each student’s progress, I adapted my coaching approach to increase their engagement and resilience throughout their academic journey.</p>
