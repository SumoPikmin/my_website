      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a second-year Master's student at the Technical University of Darmstadt specializing in Natural Language
        Processing and Machine Learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Darmstadt. As part of my
        studies, I completed two exchange semesters abroad — at Högskolan i Skövde, Sweden (January 2023 – June 2023)
        and National Taiwan University, Taiwan (February 2025 – June 2025) — gaining international academic and cultural
        experience.

      I am currently seeking a Master's thesis opportunity with a company located in the Munich area to gain valuable industry experience while completing my degree. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me.</p>

          <strong>Bachelor's Thesis: Evaluating Cultural Diversity in Text-to-Image Models </strong>
          <br><i>(June 2024 – December 2024)</i><br><br>
          I explored how well Text-to-Image (T2I) models reflect cultural diversity by creating a multilingual benchmark
          with culturally rich concepts and complex prompts. I developed a Python and LLM-based data pipeline and
          introduced a new evaluation metric using multimodal models.

          <strong>Traffic Management System: Incident Module</strong>
          <br><i>(Oct 2023 – March 2024)</i><br><br>
          As part of a university software project, I contributed to building an incident module for a railway traffic
          management system. I focused on backend logic in Python, UI development with Tkinter, and quality assurance,
          while applying agile methods and collaborative Git workflows.
